# Shipping Manager - CoPilot

## Problem Statement

When playing [Shipping Manager](http://shippingmanager.cc/) on Steam, the in-game chat suffers from a critical page reload bug. Typing certain characters causes the entire game page to refresh, making communication with alliance members nearly impossible. Messages get lost mid-typing, disrupting coordination and team play.

## Legal Disclaimer & Risk Notice

**WARNING: USE OF THIS TOOL IS AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

This tool implements automated procedures to extract session cookies from the local Steam client cache and interacts directly with the game's API (`shippingmanager.cc`).

1.  **Violation of ToS:** These techniques **most likely** violate the Terms of Service (ToS) of both **Steam** and **Shipping Manager**.
2.  **Potential Consequences:** Use of this tool may lead to the **temporary suspension** or **permanent ban** of your Steam or game account.
3.  **No Liability:** The developers of this tool **assume no liability** for any damages or consequences resulting from its use. **Every user is solely responsible for complying with the respective terms of service.**

***

## Requirements

### All Platforms
- **Node.js** 22.0 or higher (required for native TLS certificate generation)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **Python** 3.7+ (with `pip`)
- **Modern web browser** (Chrome/Chromium recommended)
- Active Shipping Manager account on Steam (alliance membership optional)

### Windows (Required for Automated Cookie Extraction)
- **`pywin32`** and **`cryptography`** Python packages (installed in Step 2)
- **`selenium`**, **`opencv-python`**, **`pillow`** (optional, for demo video/screenshot generation)

***

## Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Clone or Download
Clone the repository and navigate into the directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shipping-manager-messenger.git
cd shipping-manager-messenger
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (Node.js & Python)
Install all necessary Node.js packages and the Windows-specific Python libraries for DPAPI decryption:
```bash
# Install Node.js packages
npm install

# Install Python packages for Windows decryption
pip install pywin32 cryptography

# Optional: Install packages for demo recording
pip install selenium opencv-python pillow
```

### Step 3: Automated Startup (No Manual Cookie Required!) üöÄ

This tool uses an automated process to securely extract your current, encrypted Session Cookie directly from the Steam client cache.

#### ‚ùó Important Note on Initial Login State

The session cookie is **only generated and stored in the Steam cache** if you have **previously logged into the Steam client successfully** and **started the game `Shipping Manager` at least once**.

As long as the token remains valid (typically several weeks to months), you **do not need to repeat the Steam login process**, even if you restart or exit the Steam client.

#### Process Logic

The `run.js` wrapper script intelligently controls the startup process:

1.  **Stop:** The process attempts to terminate the Steam client to release the database lock.
2.  **Extract:** The cookie is retrieved from the unlocked database.
3.  **Start/Restart:**
    * If Steam was **already running** before the start, it will be **restarted** after cookie extraction.
    * If Steam was **not running** before the start, it will be **launched** after cookie extraction.

**Start Command:**
Use the wrapper script `run.js` to manage the entire process:
```bash
# This command executes run.js, which:
# 1. Kills Steam (if running).
# 2. Extracts the Session Cookie using the Python script.
# 3. Starts the app.js server with the fresh cookie in process.env.
# 4. Restarts Steam (if necessary, or launches it if not running).
node run.js
```

The server will be started at `https://localhost:12345`. Open this URL in your browser and accept the self-signed certificate warning.

***

## Configuration

The core configuration is located in `server/config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  PORT: 12345,
  HOST: '0.0.0.0',  // Listens on all network interfaces
  SHIPPING_MANAGER_API: 'https://shippingmanager.cc/api',
  SESSION_COOKIE: process.env.SHIPPING_MANAGER_COOKIE,  // Auto-injected by run.js

  // Rate limiting
  RATE_LIMIT: {
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,  // 15 minutes
    max: 1000
  },

  // Chat auto-refresh interval
  CHAT_REFRESH_INTERVAL: 25000  // 25 seconds
};
```

### Settings (In-App)

Access settings via the ‚öôÔ∏è button in the header:

- **Fuel Alert Threshold**: Set custom price threshold for fuel alerts (default: $400/ton)
- **CO2 Alert Threshold**: Set custom price threshold for CO2 alerts (default: $7/ton)
- **Maintenance Threshold**: Set wear percentage for automatic repair detection (10% or 20%)
- **Test Notifications**: Test browser notifications before enabling alerts
- **CA Certificate Download**: Download and install CA certificate for mobile devices (required for notifications on mobile)

***

## Certificate Authority (CA) Installation

The application automatically generates a Certificate Authority (CA) and signs the server certificate with it. This eliminates browser security warnings once the CA is installed.

### Automatic Installation (Windows Desktop)

On first startup, the application will:
1. Generate a new CA certificate (valid for 10 years)
2. Display a Windows UAC dialog requesting administrator privileges
3. Install the CA certificate into Windows Trust Store (Root Certification Authorities)
4. Generate a server certificate signed by the CA

**After installing the CA certificate, all browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) will trust the HTTPS connection without warnings.**

### Manual Installation (if automatic installation fails)

If the UAC dialog is cancelled or fails:
1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator (Right-click ‚Üí "Run as Administrator")
2. Run: `certutil -addstore -f "Root" "C:\path\to\project\ca-cert.pem"`

### Mobile Device Installation (Android/iOS)

**Required for browser notifications to work on mobile devices!**

1. Open the application in your mobile browser
2. Go to Settings (‚öôÔ∏è button)
3. Scroll down to "üîí Certificate Installation"
4. Tap "üì• Download CA Certificate"
5. Install the certificate:
   - **Android**: Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Install Certificate ‚Üí Select the downloaded file
   - **iOS**: Settings ‚Üí Profile Downloaded ‚Üí Install ‚Üí Follow prompts

**Note**: Without the CA certificate installed, mobile browsers will not allow Service Worker registration, which is required for system notifications.

### Removing the CA Certificate

**Windows:**
1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator
2. Run: `certutil -delstore Root "Shipping Manager Chat CA"`

**Android:**
1. Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Trusted Credentials ‚Üí User
2. Find "Shipping Manager Chat CA" ‚Üí Remove

**iOS:**
1. Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí VPN & Device Management
2. Find "Shipping Manager Chat CA" ‚Üí Remove Profile

### macOS Installation
```bash
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain ca-cert.pem
```

### Linux Installation
```bash
sudo cp ca-cert.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/shipping-manager-chat-ca.crt
sudo update-ca-certificates
```

***

## Network Access

The application uses HTTPS with CA-signed certificates that include all your local network IP addresses. This allows you to access the application from any device on your local network:

1. Start the server with `node run.js` and install the CA certificate (one-time setup)
2. Note the network URLs displayed in the console (e.g., `https://192.168.1.100:12345`)
3. On another device, navigate to that URL
4. **No certificate warnings** after CA installation!
5. The app is now accessible across your local network

***

## Security Notice

**Your Session Cookie is extracted automatically and dynamically!** The manual step of saving the cookie in a `.env` file is no longer required, significantly **improving local security** by preventing the sensitive value from being permanently stored in a file.

**Never share the decrypted cookie publicly!** The cookie provides full, persistent access to your Shipping Manager account.

**Security Features:**
- Session cookie only stored in memory (process.env)
- HTTPS with self-signed certificates
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Rate limiting on API calls
- Helmet middleware for security headers

## Troubleshooting

### Certificate Warnings
The self-signed certificate will trigger browser warnings. This is expected and safe for local network use. Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Proceed to localhost" (or similar).

### Mobile Notifications Not Working
If browser notifications don't appear on your mobile device:
1. **Install CA Certificate**: Go to Settings ‚Üí Certificate Installation ‚Üí Download CA Certificate
2. **Enable Notifications**: Tap "üîî Enable Notifications" button and grant permission
3. **Reload Page**: Hard refresh the page (clear cache) after installing certificate
4. **Check Browser Settings**: Ensure browser has notification permissions in device settings
5. **Test Notification**: Use "Test Browser Notification" button in settings

**Note**: Mobile Chrome requires CA certificate to be installed for Service Worker registration, which is necessary for notifications.

### Steam Not Restarting
If Steam doesn't restart automatically, check:
- Steam installation path matches default (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steam.exe`)
- You have permissions to start Steam

### Session Cookie Expired
If you get authentication errors:
1. Stop the server
2. Log into Shipping Manager via Steam
3. Restart the server with `node run.js`

### Network Access Issues
If you can't access from other devices:
1. Check your firewall allows connections on port 12345
2. Verify you're using the correct network IP address
3. Regenerate certificates: delete `cert.pem`, `key.pem`, `ca-cert.pem`, and `ca-key.pem`, then restart

### Vessel Purchase Issues
If vessel purchases fail:
- **Vessel Limit Reached**: The game has a maximum number of vessels you can own. The app will show exactly how many vessels were purchased before hitting the limit.
- **Insufficient Cash**: Make sure you have enough cash for the total purchase. The confirmation dialog shows both total cost and available cash.
- **Already Purchased**: If you try to purchase the same vessel again, it may not be available anymore. The vessel list auto-refreshes after successful purchases.
- **Network Errors**: Check your internet connection and that the game API is accessible.

All vessel purchase errors include detailed messages showing:
- Specific error reason (limit/cash/network)
- Number of vessels successfully purchased
- Clear next steps
