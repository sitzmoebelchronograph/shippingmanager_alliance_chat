# Bandit Security Scan Configuration
# https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html
#
# This configuration documents accepted security findings and explains
# why they are safe in this specific use case.

# Tests to skip with explanations:
# B501 - request_with_no_cert_validation
#        We use self-signed certificates for localhost HTTPS server.
#        verify=False is INTENTIONAL and REQUIRED.
#        Lines: helper/get-session-windows.py:198, 821
#
# B404 - import_subprocess
#        subprocess module required for Steam process management.
#        All subprocess calls use hardcoded commands, NO user input.
#
# B603 - subprocess_without_shell_equals_true
#        All subprocess calls use array arguments (not shell=True).
#        This is SAFER than shell=True.
#
# B607 - start_process_with_partial_path
#        We use Windows system commands (robocopy, taskkill).
#        These are standard Windows commands in System32.
#
# B110 - try_except_pass
#        Used for cleanup code where exceptions can be safely ignored.
